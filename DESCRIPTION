Description: A crisp, clean color palette generator inspired by American politics, with colors ranging from 
    blue on the left to gray in the middle and red on the right. A variety of palettes allow for a range of
    applications from brief discrete scales (e.g., three colors for Democrats, Independents, and Republicans) 
    to continuous interpolated arrays including dozens of shades graded from blue (left) to red (right).
